 //The algorithm of the program
 //Step 1: define variable for studentID
 //Step 2: Output prompt to user of program asking for studentID
 //Step 3: Take information from user and store it in studentID
 //Step 4: output text to user of program, including the studentID they just entered
 
//Identify with a //* 2-3 items that seem important
//Identify with a //? 2-3 items that seem incorrect, unclear or where you have questions
//Identify the different parts of the program.
//Create comments that show the algorithm of the program.
