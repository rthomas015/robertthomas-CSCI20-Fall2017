 *  Simple Number Guessing Game
 *
    Step 1: The computer randomly selects a number in a predetermined range
    Step 2: The computer will create a 'points counter' set to 10 starting points
    Step 3: Computer outputs a statement 'Please guess a number between
            [lower boundary of predetermined range] and [higher boundary of predetermined range] 
    Step 4: Computer queries user for input
    Step 5: Computer takes the number and stores the information
    Step 6: Computer checks to see if the number provided by user falls into the predetermined range
    Step 7: If the input does not fall into the correct predetermined range, then
            the computer will repeat starting at step 2 otherwise the number is valid
    Step 8: The computer will subtract one from the 'point counter'
    Step 9: The computer now compares the user input to the random number it selected, if the
            guess is more than the random number the computer will output the text "lower", 
            if the guess is less than the random number the computer will output "higher", and
            if the guess is equal to the random number it will output "correct!"
    Step 10: The computer will output the users score
